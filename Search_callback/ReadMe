In this two data structures are implemented student and employee.

Then we are creating objects of this data structures and crating a 
Douly linked list using library created and oranizing this data structure
using Doubly linked list library.

Then both traditional search logic is implemented and search callback is
implemented. In traditional way there will be lot of code duplication as there
will be the same logic for both the data structures except the condition matching
So, the search logic is offloaded to library using callback function and one generic
function is implemented in library which can be used by all the stuctures. for 
example in this case it is student and employee data structures.

callbback function needs to be registered with library for every different structure used
in the application and needs to e implementd in the application which library will use to 
find the matching record.
